* $P(T \cap S) = P(T \mid S) * P(S) = 0.2 *0.3 = 0.06$

* $P(T \cap \overline{S}) = P(T \mid \overline{S}) * P(\overline{S}) = 0.6 *0.7 = 0.42$

* $P(\overline{T} \cap S) = P(\overline{T} \mid S) * P(S) = 0.8 *0.3 = 0.24$

* $P(\overline{T} \cap \overline{S}) = P(\overline{T} \mid \overline{S}) * P(\overline{S}) = 0.7 *0.4 = 0.28$
