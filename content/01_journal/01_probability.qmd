* $P(T \cap S) = P(T \mid S) * P(S) = 0.2 *0.3 = 0.06$

* $P(T \cap \overline{S}) = P(T \mid \overline{S}) * P(\overline{S}) = 0.6 *0.7 = 0.42$

* $P(\overline{T} \cap S) = P(\overline{T} \mid S) * P(S) = 0.8 *0.3 = 0.24$

* $P(\overline{T} \cap \overline{S}) = P(\overline{T} \mid \overline{S}) * P(\overline{S}) = 0.7 *0.4 = 0.28$

* Percentage of customers using all 3 devices:  
$Smartphone \cap Tablet \cap Computer = 0.5\%$   

* Percentage of customers using at least 2 devices:  
$(Smartphone \cap Tablet \cap Computer) + (Smartphone \cap Tablet) +(Tablet \cap Computer) + (Smartphone \cap Computer)$   
$= 0.5\% + 7.3\% + 3.3\% + 8.8\% = 19.9\%$  

* Percentage of customers using only 1 device = Percentage of users - Percentage of users using at least 2 devices:  
$100\% - 19.9\% = 80.1\%$
