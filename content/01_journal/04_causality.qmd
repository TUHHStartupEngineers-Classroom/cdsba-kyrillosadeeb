# Plotting a Spurious Correlation

This is a plot of one of the spurious correlations that relates US spending on science, space and technology to Suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation. I couldn't find the data as a data set so I generated similar data to plot the graphs.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

#Number of entries 
n <- 20

# Create Hanging Suicides Data
hanging_suicide <- tibble(
  y = rnorm(n, exp(seq(from = 2, to = 4, length.out = n)), sd = 1),
  x = seq(from = 1999, to = 2009, length.out = n)
)

#Creating US spending data
US_spending <- tibble(
  y1 = rnorm(n, exp(seq(from = 2, to = 4, length.out = n)), sd = 3),
  x1 = seq(from = 1999, to = 2009, length.out = n)
)

p1 <- ggplot(hanging_suicide, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  xlab("Years")+
  ylab("No. of suicides (x100)")+
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = 'red')
  
p2 <- ggplot(US_spending, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +
  xlab("Years")+
  ylab("Money Spent (Billions)")+
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = 'blue')

p1 + p2
```
